## Data Structures with the functional pattern

In this 1 day sprint you will be implementing 2 data structures that are commonly used in computer science: stacks and queues. You have already learned about one use of stacks: for keeping track of a pile of functions that are in the process of execution. A queue data structure would be useful on occasions where you want to process tasks in the same order as they arrive, such as in a messaging application or a printer queue.

# Core Goals

## Stacks

1.  Implement a `createStack` factory function. Your `createStack` function should create a stack instance with appropriate **properties** and **methods**.  You should do a small amount of research to find out what the stack data-structure looks like.  Here is a link to get you started: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/stack_algorithm.htm


## Queues

2.  Implement a `createQueue` factory function that returns a queue instance.  The `createQueue` function will take a single argument representing the limit of the number of items in the queue.  Again you can follow the above link for a good e


#### Important!

* You may **not** use JavaScript arrays or any array methods or properties to implement your stack and queue structures. Everything should be implemented with objects and custom methods.

* An important feature of this sprint is that you are able to research and lookup documentation or explanations and interpret these to come up with your own solutions.  A key part of being a developer!

# Advanced - only attempt these if you get through stacks and queues!

* For the advanced section you will have to do some research of your own for information about each data structure.

1) Implement the set data structure. [Sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)) have lots of potential methods you could implement so pick out a few that seem most useful/interesting and implement those.

2) Implement the tree data structure. [Trees] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) also have a lot of methods, many of which may come into tomorrow's sprint. Focus today on implementing methods that add and remove data (e.g. addData, removeData) or return a boolean, (e.g. isParent, isRoot, hasSiblings, isLeaf). Look through the article for ideas on the terminology to use.

3) If you finish this, have a look for other potential data structures and see if you can implement useful functions they may have.

### Learning objectives

- Fully understand the functional pattern of object creation in JavaScript,           together with its pros and cons. 
- Learn, throughout the sprint, about the 4 rules of `this` in JavaScript.
- Introduce yourself to data structures.
