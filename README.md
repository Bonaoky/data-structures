## Data Structures with Object Creational Patterns

In this 2 day sprint you will be implementing 2 or 3 data structures that are commonly used in computer science: stacks, queues and sets. You have already learned about one use of stacks: for keeping track of a pile of functions that are in the process of execution. A queue data structure would be useful on occasions where you want to process tasks in the same order as they arrive, such as in a messaging application or a printer queue. Sets are used to keep track of groups of unique values and have useful methods such as `union` which can join two sets of unique values into one.

# Core Goals

1. Research **stacks** and **queues** and their corresponding public APIs. Make sure you understand how they operate internally and double check with us that you have a good understanding of their public methods before you start.

2. Implement these two data structures using the object creational pattern explained on Day 1.

3. Be sure to test your functions as you go.

4. Implement each creational pattern in its own file with its own test file.

5. On Day 2 we'll introduce a second pattern for object creation. Refactor your code to use this pattern.
  
#### Important!
You may **not** use JavaScript arrays or any array methods or properties to implement your stack and queue structures. Everything should be implemented with objects and custom methods.

# Advanced

1) Implement the set data structure. [Sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)) have lots of potential methods you could implement so pick out a few that seem most useful/interesting and implement those.

2) Implement the tree data structure. [Trees] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) also have a lot of methods, many of which may come into tomorrow's sprint. Focus today on implementing methods that add and remove data (e.g. addData, removeData) or return a boolean, (e.g. isParent, isRoot, hasSiblings, isLeaf). Look through the article for ideas on the terminology to use.

3) If you finish this, have a look for other potential data structures and see if you can implement useful functions they may have.

### Learning objectives

- Fully understand the different ways that you can create objects in JavaScript, together with their pros and cons.
- Learn, throughout the sprint, about the 4 rules of `this` in JavaScript
- Introduce yourself to data structures.
