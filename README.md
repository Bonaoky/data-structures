## Data Structures with Object Creational Patterns

In this 2 day sprint you will be implementing 2 or 3 data structures that are commonly used in computer science: stacks, queues and sets. You have already learned about one use of stacks: for keeping track of a pile of functions that are in the process of execution. A queue data structure would be useful on occasions where you want to process tasks in the same order as they arrive, such as in a messaging application or a printer queue. Sets are used to keep track of groups of unique values and have useful methods such as `union` which can join two sets of unique values into one.

# Lectures

The lectures introduce you to four different object creational patterns that you will be using to create new instances of stacks, queues and sets. The first two lectures focus on the **functional** and **functional shared** pattern.

- [Functional Shared Pattern](https://youtu.be/oYD7yErGmb0)

After lunch we will look at JavaScript prototypes, the prototype chain, and the **prototypal pattern** of object creation.

On the second day of this sprint the lectures will look at the final **pseudoclassical** pattern.

# Core Goals

1. Research **stacks** and **queues** and their corresponding public APIs. Make sure you understand how they operate internally and double check with us that you have a good understanding of their public methods before you start.

2. Implement these two data structures 4 times, once for each Object Creational Pattern that we'll show in the lectures (functional,  functional-shared, prototypal & pseudo-classical).

3. Be sure to test your functions as you go.

4. Implement each creational pattern in its own file with its own test file.
  
#### Important!
You may **not** use JavaScript arrays or any array methods or properties to implement your stack and queue structures. Everything should be implemented with objects and custom methods.

# Advanced

##Â Sets

Implement a set constructor for every object creational pattern. [Sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)) have lots of potential methods you could implement so pick out a few that seem most useful/interesting and implement those.


## Advanced testing 

At first glance, it might appear that each spec needs only minor changes. Extra credit if you write tests that confirm that the implementation actually implements the relevant object creational pattern.

This will require some serious thought about what commonalities there are between each of the patterns (e.g. which declare variables? Which reuse methods? Which have their own methods?) and how you would test such commonalities.

### Learning objectives

- Fully understand the different ways that you can create objects in JavaScript, together with their pros and cons.
- Learn, throughout the sprint, about the 4 rules of `this` in JavaScript
- Introduce yourself to data structures.
