## Stacks and Queues with 4 Object Creational Patterns

In this 2 day sprint you will be implementing two data structures that are commonly used in computer programming: stacks and queues. You have already learned about one use of stacks: for keeping track of a pile of functions that are in the process of execution. A queue data structure would be useful on occasions where you want to process tasks in the same order as they arrive, such as in a messaging application or a printer queue.

#### Goals

1. Research stacks & queues and their corresponding public APIs. Make sure you understand the concept of LIFO and FIFO data structures. Before starting, double check with us that you have a good understanding of their public methods.

2. Write code for a stack and a queue using each of the 4 different object creational patterns (functional, functional-shared, prototypal & pseudo-classical).

3. Be sure to test your functions as you go.

4. You will end up with eight source files and eight test files. One stack and one queue for each Object pattern.

It's very important that after you finish each exercise you try not to reference the code (whether source or test) of the previous one. Attack it afresh if you can. You must not use JavaScript Arrays (and thus of the array methods such as push, pop). Use objects only.

### Extra credit

At first glance, it might appear that each spec needs only minor changes. Extra credit if you write tests that confirm that the implementation actually implements the relevant object creational pattern.

This will require some serious thought about what commonalities there are between each of the patterns (e.g. which declare variables? Which reuse methods? Which have their own methods?) and how you would test such commonalities.

### Learning objectives

- Fully understand the different ways that you can create objects in JavaScript, together with their pros and cons.
- Learn, throughout the sprint, about the 4 rules of `this` in JavaScript
- Introduce yourself to data structures.
