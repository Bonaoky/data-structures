## Data Structures with Object Creational Patterns

In this 2 day sprint you will be implementing three data structures that are commonly used in computer science: stacks, queues and sets. You have already learned about one use of stacks: for keeping track of a pile of functions that are in the process of execution. A queue data structure would be useful on occasions where you want to process tasks in the same order as they arrive, such as in a messaging application or a printer queue. Sets are used to keep track of groups of unique values, e.g. do all users in a group belong to a bigger group?

#### Goals

1. Research the data structures and their corresponding public APIs. Make sure you understand how they operate internally and double check with us that you have a good understanding of their public methods before you start.

2. Implement all data structures 4 times, once for each Object Creational Pattern that we'll show in the lectures (functional,  functional-shared, prototypal & pseudo-classical).

3. Be sure to test your functions as you go.

4. Implement each creational pattern in its own file with its own test file.
  
#### Important!
You may **not** use JavaScript arrays or any array methods or properties to implement the data structures. Everything should be implemented with objects and custom methods.

### Extra credit

At first glance, it might appear that each spec needs only minor changes. Extra credit if you write tests that confirm that the implementation actually implements the relevant object creational pattern.

This will require some serious thought about what commonalities there are between each of the patterns (e.g. which declare variables? Which reuse methods? Which have their own methods?) and how you would test such commonalities.

### Learning objectives

- Fully understand the different ways that you can create objects in JavaScript, together with their pros and cons.
- Learn, throughout the sprint, about the 4 rules of `this` in JavaScript
- Introduce yourself to data structures.
